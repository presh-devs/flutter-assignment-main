Notes:
Due to the figma design not available I'm unable to use the exact font, fontsizes and colors in the provided screenshot, so there might be discrepancies.
I  assumed the subarea-block-house format to be subarea- text, block-digit, house - digit e.g London-19-15 is the format accepted.
When the next button is clicked an adrress object is created which saves the data.
